       <hr>
       <p> Silver Cascade is one of Kodaikanal’s most popular attractions. Here, watch shimmering water flowing down a 180-foot-tall (55-meter) cliff and monkeys playing mischievously on slippery rocks. Silver Cascade is the result of excess water that flows from Kodaikanal Lake. It takes its name from the silver-colored appearance of the water, which glistens in the bright sunshine.</p>
